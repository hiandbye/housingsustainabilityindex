        The Housing Sustainability Index is a program designed to inform renters of the total cost of renting a place in the Bellingham area before they even sign the lease.
        <br><br>
        When you have looked for a rental in the past, have you ever thought about the cost of utilities? What about your commute? Now, with the Housing Sustainability Index, you can be empowered to make smart and informed decisions on what property to rent. On the site, you can see how much your rent and utilities can cost, as well as whether or not a rental is near a bus line or bike lanes.
        <br><br>
        We are constantly looking for ways to improve on the site. Coming soon, a new version of the site will be available, including features such as WalkScore integration, easier access to our information portal to input information on rentals, and Compare Your Commute â€“ a tool that helps you choose a property that is centrally located to where you go the most. Check back in Spring 2017 for these updates!
